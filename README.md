# GraphRag
Microsoft GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) improves upon traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Standard RAG) systems by utilizing knowledge graphs created by large language models (LLMs).Â 
This approach involves building a structured knowledge graph from a collection of documents, pinpointing key entities like people, places, and concepts, and representing them as nodes in a graph.

In this notebook we will be implementing a Microsoft Graphrag ingestion pipeline to create a graph from the raw text data and will run few queries on the craeted graph 



# Prerequisites
## 1. Conda Environment
Please create a Python 3.10-3.12 Conda environment with below commands. 

    conda create -n graph python=3.11 -y && conda activate graph

    pip install graphrag

    conda activate graph

We will use the "graph" Conda environment to run the GraphRAG.ipynb notebook and create the graph indexes.
## 2. Input Data
The text file need to be placed inside an **input** folder so that the Graph init command can read the text files

    - The file location for this notebook is a local drive

You can also use the Microsoft Fabric OneLake location by following below steps 

    - Download and Install the Onelake file explorer from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105222 

    - Once installed you will be able to browse to your Fabric workspace and oneLake

    - Copy the text file which you want to be gaphed inside the Files folder in oneLake
