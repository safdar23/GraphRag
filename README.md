# GraphRag
Microsoft GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) improves upon traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Standard RAG) systems by utilizing knowledge graphs created by large language models (LLMs).Â 
This approach involves building a structured knowledge graph from a collection of documents, pinpointing key entities like people, places, and concepts, and representing them as nodes in a graph.

In this notebook we will be implementing a Microsoft Graphrag ingestion pipeline to create a graph from the raw text data and will run few queries on the craeted graph
